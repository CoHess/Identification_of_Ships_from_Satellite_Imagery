# Identification_of_Ships_from_Satellite_Imagery

### Description:
The aim of this project was to classify satellilte images as containing or not containing ships. The dataset was provided by Planet labs and can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery). For this project I was able to very accurately classify images using conventional classification techniques, instead of deep learning techniques such as CNN. This was acheived by extracting features from the images such as pixel ratios, PCA, and some shape features - then using these as input to classification algorithms.
